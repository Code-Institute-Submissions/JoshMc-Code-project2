### Features Left to Implement

-__Round History Button__
  -A button to show the current game's round history, showing the user choice, the computer choice and the result for each round.
  This would be useful as the user could see how the game was won or lost.

-__Help Button__
  -A button to show the current game's rules and logic in a new page or page alert.
  -This would be useful as my game is an extension of regular Rock Paper Scissors that some users may not be familar with.

Throughout building this website I have been testing my code using different methods. Using Chrome dev tools I have been able to utilise breakpoints and the console tab to check my code at different stages.
I used the console and breakpoints to test the buttons, results area, score area and replay button

I then used Chrome dev tools to test how the website would look and function on smaller devices:

### Unfixed Bugs

In this website I have a few unfixed bugs.
My first issue is with the Javascript:
- ![JS bug](https://i.ibb.co/SV5z4RQ/testing-js-error.jpg)
- It seems my code will run through a couple of times before breaking and displaying this error message in the console. This bug does not seem to affect the overall performance of the game or website so I have no debugged it as of yet.
- My second issue is with the button images showing on GitHub Pages:
- ![CSS bug](https://i.ibb.co/fSJncH3/testing-css-error.jpg) 
- My images are showing when im viewing my website through GitPod preview however when the page is deployed the issue with the images occurs. This suggests the issue is with GitHub pages and could possibly be resolved from there.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. I had some extra work to do in order to get my project deployed on GitHub pages as my GitPod and GitHub refused to link together meaning I had to manually upload new files to my Github repository. Once this was done the deployment was quite straight forward. The steps to deploy are as follows: 

-On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.

-Under your repository name, click  Settings.
Repository settings button

-Under the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click  Pages.

-Under "Build and deployment"  select "Source", select Deploy from a branch.

-Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", select main, then save.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. 

### Content 
HTML and CSS content from CodeInstitute's Love Maths example project has been used and editted to suit my own website.

Some help with the logic of a rock paper scissors game was found in the code from this site: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rock-paper-and-scissor-game-using-javascript/)
